							<h1>Project Disabled</h1>
							<p align="left">Education in Bhutan is affected by discrimination, in terms of physical and intellectual disabilities. When I visited Bhutan during my summer break in 2016, I noticed a lot of children had weak eyesight due to genetic factors. These kids were not sent to schools and there were only a few schools for these children all around the country.</p>


							<p align="left">On the first day, I'd met Chengkpo and Pema in Thimphu, the capital city of Bhutan. Chengkpo told me about his life and his education. Chengkpo was born in one of the remote villages of west Bhutan, far from even the influence of urbanisation. He was four when his parents left him in an orphanage because of his disability. He was blind. He started managing all his work by himself. When he was six years old, he went to a public school in Thimphu. He had no friends there. His peers teased and humiliated him. More than twice, he felt compelled to give up on life. It was with extreme difficulty that he managed to rise above. He is twenty years old now. To make sure that children like him do not have to endure similar suffering, he joined the Disabled Persons' Association of Bhutan in 2013 and he is working for the attainment of inclusive society in Bhutan.</p>


							<p align="left">The story of his life is inspiring. I decided to take up his cause to a greater level. I joined the Disabled Persons' Association of Bhutan the very next day and started working for the introduction of inclusive education in every school around the country. In the span of one month, I went to fourteen schools around eight villages along with the Chengkpo, organised workshops and sessions on the importance of an inclusive society and an inclusive education system. A majority of these schools agreed to provide free education to the students with disability. I worked in The Music School for Disabled Students and realised that art is one essential element that can curb all difficulties and regrets in one's life. The 2016 summer break was perhaps the most fruitful time of my life.</p>
